# Blood Donor Management System

People donate blood every day. To ensure that the blood is trasferred safely, both recipients, and donors go through a checklist with a nurse. The checklist covers things that could introduce bloodborne diseases to the recipients, and to validate the bloodtype compatibility. In the rare case that a disease has no symptoms during the checklist, but is contagious by blood, the recipient could receive blood that is infected. This system allows for the notification, and tracking of all recipients that could be affected by that donor.
